# simple-msa

## Introduce
This project is a simple MSA (Microservices Architecture) project. 
It involves implementing service discovery, API gateway, config server, and services 1 and 2 using Spring Boot.
The goal is to study MSA through practical implementation.
All the content is based on what I've learned from the following [link](https://enjoy-dev.tistory.com/category/Spring%20Cloud).
